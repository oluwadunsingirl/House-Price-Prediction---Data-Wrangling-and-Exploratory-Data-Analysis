### Result and Evaluation
-Features such as area, number of bedrooms, parking and preferred area showed the strongest relationship with price during
data exploration.

- The linear regression baseline model achieved an r2 score of 0.6529242642153185 meaning that,
the model explains 65% of thevaraince in price.

- The model mean square error was 1.75 trillion, mse shows that the predictions has large error (in millions), meaning the linear model struggles with capturing complex patterns.
- RMSE gives an average prediction error of roughly 1.3 million per house price prediction.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
The baseline linear regression model provides a moderate fit for predicting house prices, explaining about two-thirds of the
variability in the dataset. The high prediction error however suggests that more advanced models such as random forest would be necessary for more accurate predictions.
