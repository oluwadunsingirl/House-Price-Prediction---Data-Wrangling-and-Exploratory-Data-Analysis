### Result and Evaluation
-Features such as area, number of bedrooms, parking and preferred area showed the strongest relationship with price during
data exploration.

- To benchmark the models perfomance, I started with a baseline model that predicts the mean house price ($4.7M), this approach 
produced a mean absolute error(MAE) of about 1.35M, which meant that the baseline prediction (of 4.7M) was off by about 1.3M
on average.
Next, I trained a Linear Regression Model on the training data set, the model achieved an MAE of 0.72M, which is a significant 
improvement over the baseline model. This indicates that the model is able to capture meaningful relationship between features
(such as area, number of rooms etc.) and price.

### Conclusion 
The model was evaluated on the test data to check generalisation. The test set MAE was (0.970M), confirming that the model 
generalises reasonably well on unseen data.

### Recommendation
The model can be improved through feature engineering and applying hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
Additionally, other model that perform better on structured data can be used such as, Decision Tree and Random Forest for better
model performance.
